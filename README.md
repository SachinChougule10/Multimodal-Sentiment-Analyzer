# Multimodal-Sentiment-Analyzer

1. Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, NLTK, Librosa, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Git.
2. Designed and implemented a deep learning model to analyze sentiment from text, audio, and video inputs.
3. Preprocessed data using tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction techniques for structured model train-
ing.
4. Developed and trained a PyTorch-based neural network, optimizing learning rates and handling class imbalance.
5. Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and visualized results with TensorBoard.
6. Applied transfer learning to enhance accuracy and efficiency in sentiment classification.
